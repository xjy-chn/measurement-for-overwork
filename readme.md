# codes for Repository:Measuring Overwork in China Using Daily High-Resolution Nighttime Satellite Data

- We put our codes in two folders

  - code for data

  - code for results

if you want to replicate our research, the fold "code for data" should run at first to acquire our data in figshare. The raw data can be download from earth data https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/5000/VNP46A2.

"code for results" can then be used to draw the figure in our paper  and acquire the results in our tabs.

The number before the program represents the order to run. You can run the program in a folder if no number marked at the begin of the file name.
